## 🚀 Kya Naukri Milegi? - The "Official" Repo

So... you found the GitHub repo. Clever.

What, did you expect to find an `answers.txt` file here?

Welcome, hacker.

## 🧐 About This "Project"

This project is a highly-complex, enterprise-grade, AI-driven, synergistic, Web 5.0 Applicant Tracking System (ATS)...

...okay, I'm kidding.

It's actually just a fun little treasure hunt game we cooked up to find the best talent out there. If you can crack the code and find the hidden password, you might just land yourself with the first prize...

## ⚠️ WARNING: You Won't Get a Job Here

Seriously. This is a game. The code is in this repo, but the answers aren't just lying around.

Cloning this repo and running `npm install` will just make your laptop as slow as an employee's appraisal cycle. It won't get you the answers.

```bash
# Don't waste your time doing this
git clone https://github.com/ANAS727189/TreasureHunt
npm install
npm run dev
```

Why? Did you think you could run it locally, check `console.log()`, and find the password? Nice try, champ. Not that easy.

## Features (AKA Traps)

We designed this "application" specifically for smarty-pants people like you:

* **8 Ways to Fail:** Because the "You're Unemployable" screen is its own reward.
* **Only 1 Way to Win:** Good luck finding it.
