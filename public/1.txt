HR is monitoring our website, so I've hidden the next key on GitHub.
I hid it in a place so full of spam that no one would ever look for a real secret there.
The Riddle:
Navigate to the GitHub repository for the most 'expressive' web framework 
(Hint: it shares its name with a JavaScript runtime).
During the great October spam flood known as Hacktoberfest, hundreds of junk PRs buried this repo. Your mission: find the ultimate meta-joke PR - a sarcastic protest so fed up with the spam that it literally tried to "delete the Readme" as a statement.
How to find it:

Go to the Pull Requests tab
Filter by: Closed PRs
Search for PRs from October (the Hacktoberfest month)
Look for one with an obviously satirical title about deleting the readme
Ignore the simple typo fixes and trivial spam—find the legendary one that became a symbol of the chaos

The 4-digit code you need is the Pull Request number (#XXXX).
